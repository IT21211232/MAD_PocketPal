##Introduction
PocketPal is a finance management system, which allows the users to keep track of their transactions, in terms of income and expenses. This system makes it possible for the users to add their sources of income such as investments, salaries, and any other source through which a revenue is generated. Furthermore, the system allows the customers to enter their daily expenses simply by selecting the categories provided and then entering the amount for the relevant transaction, making it possible for them to get a clear understanding of their spending and saving habits. This feature enables the users to get a clear insight of their daily and monthly expenses and guides them in making accurate and informed decisions about their financial goals and expenses. The system also contains a savings management system which is responsible in maintaining the difference between the income and expense. The system then, depending on whether it is a positive balance or a negative balance request the user to move it to the savings account. The user also has the ability to set targets for each category of expenses.
